      <h6 id="note">
        This blog is created with the sole purpose of recording the deaths of all 
        the farmers or supporters of Famers’ Protest 2020-2021 happening currently at 
        the borders of Delhi, India. This is to remind everyone of the human cost of 
        the protest lest one forgets what this fight is against. This is also to 
        commemorate the participation of these martyrs towards a cause that is bigger 
        than just farmers’ rights and is emerging as a movement for the rights of 
        the entire humanity. I have been assisted by Harinder Happy (resource person) 
        [IG @emptypocketofheart]  and Sajneet Mangat (data visualisation)  
        [IG @womangat] since January 2021 in the maintenance and updating of this list. 
        I will appreciate it if the readers can drop in any data related to 
        deaths at Farmers' Protest that might be missing from this blog 
        or point out erroneous data in the comments.

      <span id="sub-note">
        Note: The death data is not arranged according to the chronological order. 
        By “Illness” I mean general illness and not covid as most of them have died 
        in hospitals and none of newspaper sources report indicated covid.
