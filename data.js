                for the past two days as the temperature had dipped. In the early hours on Tuesday, he collapsed 
                to his death at the border morcha. Surjeet Singh, who was also at the protest site, said that 
                Gurmeet Singh complained of chest pain before his death.” “My father was involved in the 
                protest against the new agri laws from day one. He was among the first people that 
                had gone to Delhi. I used to speak to him regularly and he told me that he would 
                come only after the government repeals farm laws,” farmer Gurmeet Singh’s son, Sukhbir Singh Babbu, 
                said.
                He added that his father did not have any such disease and was also not taking any medicines. 
                The family, which owns six acres of land, came to know about the death at 1 pm Tuesday.”`,
